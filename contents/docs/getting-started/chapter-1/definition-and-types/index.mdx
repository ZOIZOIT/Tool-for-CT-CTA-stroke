## Definition

A **stroke** or **cerebrovascular accident (CVA)** is a clinical syndrome defined by a sudden onset of neurological deficits that last more than 24 hours, as a result of vascular causes. A stroke occurs when the blood supply to or in the brain is interrupted or reduced leading to oxygen deprivation and lack of nutrients in the affected region.

Brain is highly sensitive to blood flow changes. Therefore, a CVA is an emergency situation that requires immediate attention otherwise, within minutes after the onset, cells begin to die leading to irreversible tissue damage.
The 4 key features of a classic stroke are:

1. Sudden onset
2. Focal involvement of the central nervous system
3. Lack of rapid resolution
4. Vascular cause

## Sudden onset and lack of rapid resolution

The acute onset of the symptoms of a stroke and the duration of the neurologic deficits is documented by the patient's history. Strokes begin abruptly and focal cerebral deficits typically develop and establish within seconds to hours. When slowly developing, focal cerebral deficits are unlikely to be due to stroke and, therefore, should raise concerns about other possible causes like inflammatory or degenerative diseases or an underlying tumor.

The intensity of the neurologic deficits may be either maximal, stabilized and not progressing at the onset of the stroke **(completed stroke)** or progress over seconds to hours and occasionally days as the stroke evolves (**progressing stroke** or **stroke in evolution**). Strokes in evolution are characterized by active progression as a direct consequence of the underlying vascular disorder and not because of the associated cerebral edema.

According to the classic definition of stroke, deficits should persist for more than 24 hours. If not, then the term used to describe this situation is **Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)**. Despite using the 24 hours threshold to distinguish a classic stroke form a TIE, this point is arbitrary, as transient ischemic attacks usually resolve within 1 hour. TIAs leave no evidence of cerebral infraction, which means no detectable clinical deficits and no imaging signs of current stroke.

As we can see at Figure 1-1, a transient ischemic attack (TIE) is characterized by deficits that resolve completely after brief periods (typically within 1 hour). A progressing stroke (or stroke in evolution) causes deficits that worsen as the patient is seen. A completed stroke presents established, persistent deficits (this does not mean that no improvement is made or that made whole area of the involved vessel is affected).

## Focal involvement of the CNS

A patient with stroke presents with focal symptoms and signs related to the brain area supplied by the affected vessel. The most common mechanisms include ischemia or hemorrhage (they are going to be further discussed later). **Ischemia** usually produces a stereotyped pattern of deficits because the occlusion of the vessel interrupts the blood flow to a certain area of the brain. On the other hand, **hemorrhage**, may cause several complications that cause the production of a less predictable pattern. Such situations may be cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure or dispersion of blood through the subarachnoid space. As a result, brain function to areas remote from the hemorrhage may be affected. Brain may also be affected in a more diffuse way by situations such as subarachnoid hemorrhage or global cerebral ischemia (not included to the classic definition of stroke). Taking into consideration the symptoms, neurologic examination and imaging studies, can define the precise site affected. Imaging studies may be computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

## Vascular causes

Unlike other conditions that can cause sudden onset and lack of rapid resolution of focal central neurologic deficits (hypoglycemia and other metabolic disturbances, trauma, seizures) the term stroke is used only when such events are the result of vascular disease. The majority of strokes (approximately 90%) [3] fall into the category of ischemia. For the rest, the underlying pathologic process is hemorrhage. The patientâ€™s age, the presence of risk factors for stroke and the occurrence of symptoms and signs referable to the territory of a particular cerebral blood vessel are key characteristics of the situation that help the diagnosis. Of course, imaging studies are required, as it may not be possible to distinguish the cause by history and neurologic examination. CT scan or MRI permits definitive diagnosis. When a stroke is confirmed by imaging studies, further investigations can be undertaken to identify a more specific cause. Ischemic strokes may be attributed to cardiac embolism, large artery occlusion or small artery occlusion.
