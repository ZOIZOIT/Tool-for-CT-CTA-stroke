title: Etiology and Risk Factors
---

Stroke causes and risk factors cover a wide range of diseases and possible underlying situations which may lead immediately or gradually to the appearance of symptoms of stroke. Preventing a disease is always better than treating it. That is why it is important to regulate or treat the modifiable risk factors and be aware of the non-modifiable ones.

Nonmodifiable risk factors include increased age, male sex, low birth weight, African American ethnicity and family history of stroke. Modifiable risk factors can be divided to vascular, cardiac, endocrine, hematologic, metabolic and of course lifestyle as mentioned below.

**Vascular**: hypertension (BP >140 mm Hg systolic or 90 mm Hg diastolic), smoking, asymptomatic carotid stenosis (>60% diameter), peripheral artery disease

**Cardiac**: atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease

**Endocrine**: diabetes mellitus, postmenopausal hormone therapy (estrogen ± progesterone), oral contraceptive use

**Metabolic**: dyslipidemia (high total cholesterol – top 20% and low HDL cholesterol &lt;40 mg/dL), obesity (especially abdominal)

**Hematologic**: sickle cell disease

**Lifestyle**: physical inactivity

Monogenic disorders associated with stroke include amyloid angiopathy, small vessel disease, sickle cell anemia, cerebral cavernous malformations, Marfan syndrome, Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
