title: Development of the educational application
---

The development of the educational application was done using Next.js and the AriaDocs template for Next JS, which provide an easy and accessible layout. The application offers a clean interface for learning information about Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). An effort was made to create a user-friendly environment as much as possible with fast response and ensuring maximum compatibility with various types of electronic devices such as smartphones, desktops and laptops. The structure of the application was designed to initially present the theoretical content in combination with images for better understanding of the information and then the quiz that aims at the user’s self-assessment.

## Quiz Functionality

The educational application features a quiz designed for the users’ self-assessment. The quiz randomly selects 30 questions from a bank of 100 multiple-choice questions to ensure variety. The questions cover the basic anatomy and physiology of the eye, the physical principles of operation of OCT systems and the diseases diagnosed with this technology. Users answer the quiz by selecting their answers, and when finished, a detailed page with the correct answers appears. The results page is showing the number of correct and incorrect answers along with the correct answers for the user’s review. This approach allows them to review their incorrect answers. The quiz is generated each time with a randomised selection of questions to prevent memorisation.
