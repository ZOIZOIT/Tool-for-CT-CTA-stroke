title: Methods and Technologies Used

The development of the educational application was done using NetxJS which is a ReactJS Framework for Web development. NetxJS is a tool that adds powerful features and makes it easier and faster to build complete, fast, user friendly and modern websites. AriaDocs was used as a template for the App. AriaDocs template offers pre-designed components and styling to create well-structured documentation pages. MDX files were used for the documentation. MDX is a special file format that combines Markdown with JSX and allows to write clean, readable content while also embedding interactive elements. It is ideal for modern documentation because it supports both static content and dynamic, reusable components, making the documentation more engaging and easier to maintain. CSS was used for the styling to provide design responsiveness and make the website visually appealing and user-friendly. Great care was taken to design a user-friendly environment that offers fast responsiveness and ensures broad compatibility across a wide range of devices, including smartphones, desktops, and laptops. Finally, the application is deployed on Vercel, a cloud platform specifically optimized for hosting Next.js applications.
