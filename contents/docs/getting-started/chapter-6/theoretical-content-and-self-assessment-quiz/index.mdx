title: Theoretical Content and Self Assessment Quiz
---

The application is structured to initially present the necessary theoretical background combined with images for better understanding. The theoretical section includes everything the reader needs to know about the basic principles of operation of CT and CTA, the pathology of stroke, and finally, the neuroimaging of stroke using these methods, as well as the contribution of each method to the diagnostic process.
All of this is followed by a self-assessment quiz, which selects 30 questions from a pool of 110, offering variety and broad coverage of the theory. Each time, 30 questions are randomly selected, preventing memorization of the quiz. This may also prove potentially useful for simultaneously evaluating multiple students in a group exam setting. Users answer the quiz by selecting their answers, and upon completion, a detailed results page is displayed with all the correct answers. The results page shows the number of correct and incorrect answers along with the correct answers for the userâ€™s review.
