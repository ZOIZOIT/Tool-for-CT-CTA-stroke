title: Limitations and future work
---

The main limitation of the presented application is that it has not yet been evaluated by a large number of users. Addressing this constitutes a primary objective for future development—specifically, encouraging adoption by a broader audience of students, residents, and healthcare professionals involved in the field, in order to facilitate a more comprehensive evaluation of the application's effectiveness.
A potential enhancement for future improvement of the application could be the categorization of quiz questions based on content areas, allowing users to select the specific topic they wish to self-assess—for example, "basic principles of CT/CTA interpretation" or "stroke etiology."
Furthermore, a future objective is also to enable the presentation of complete CT or CTA studies, rather than isolated slices, in both the theoretical section and the quiz. This will allow users to interact with the scans in a manner that closely replicates the experience of a real-world clinical setting. However, this is certainly a more challenging step, as it requires specialized software and access to clinical data.
Furthermore, as previously mentioned, each quiz session currently generates a random set of 30 questions, a feature that could be effectively utilized in educational settings that require simultaneous assessment of multiple students, each receiving a different set of questions. In such cases, it would be particularly beneficial if the theoretical content were delivered in video format as part of the course, with an assessment following at the end.
This approach would reduce the time required for reading prior to evaluation and help to minimize inter-individual variability in content exposure. In this way, all participants are taught the same material within a shared timeframe and can be evaluated consistently at the conclusion of the lesson.
