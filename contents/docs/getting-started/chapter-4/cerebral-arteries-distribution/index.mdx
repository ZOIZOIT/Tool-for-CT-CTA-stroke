title: Cerebral Arteries Distribution
---

Interruption of blood flow in the distribution of different cerebral arteries can produce distinctive clinical syndromes, which can help guide diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, knowledge of the anatomy of both brain and its arteries is essential to achieve the best possible outcome.

Anterior cerebral artery (ACA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) form the three pairs of main arteries in the brain. Anterior and posterior circulation are the two main categories of blood supply to the brain. The circle of Wills is a circuit of anastomosis between these main systems.

## Anterior circulation arteries

**Anterior cerebral** artery branches from the internal carotid artery. It supplies the parasagittal cerebral cortex, which encompasses regions of the motor and sensory cortex associated with the contralateral leg, the micturition center (also known as the bladder inhibitory center), and the anterior portion of the corpus callosum. Infarcts in the ACA territory typically result in contralateral paralysis and sensory loss, predominantly or exclusively involving the lower limb. Additional manifestations may include abulia (a state of apathy or lack of will), disconnection syndromes such as alien hand syndrome (involuntary complex motor activity), transcortical expressive aphasia, and urinary incontinence.

**Middle cerebral artery** also branches from the internal carotid artery. It supplies most of the remaining portions of the cerebral hemisphere, as well as deep subcortical structures. Its cortical branches include:

- The superior division: It supplies the motor and sensory areas representing the face, hand, and arm, along with the expressive language area (Broca's area) in the dominant hemisphere.

- The inferior division: It supplies to the visual radiations, the visual cortex related to macular vision, and the receptive language area (Wernicke's area) in the dominant hemisphere.

Additionally, lenticulostriate arteries, arising from the proximal stem of the MCA, supply the basal ganglia and the descending motor fibers for the face, hand, arm, and leg, particularly as they pass through the genu and posterior limb of the internal capsule.

**Superior Division Infarction** causes contralateral hemiparesis affecting the face, hand, and arm, typically sparing the leg and is also associated hemisensory loss in the same distribution. It is not characterized by homonymous hemianopia. Involvement of the dominant hemisphere leads to Broca’s aphasia: impaired speech production with preserved comprehension. **Inferior Division Infarction** produces contralateral homonymous hemianopia, often more pronounced in the inferior visual field and impairs cortical sensory functions (e.g., graphesthesia, stereognosis) on the contralateral side. It may also result in disorders of spatial cognition, including anosognosia, contralateral neglect, dressing apraxia, constructional apraxia. If the dominant hemisphere is affected, Wernicke’s aphasia occurs (fluent, nonsensical speech with impaired comprehension). If the nondominant hemisphere is affected, it may lead to an acute confusional state. **Bifurcation or Trifurcation Occlusion** combines features of both superior and inferior division infarcts. It results in contralateral hemiparesis and sensory loss affecting the face and arm more than the leg, homonymous hemianopia and in dominant hemisphere infarcts it causes global aphasia (combining both expressive and receptive deficits). **MCA Stem Occlusion** occurs proximal to the lenticulostriate branches. It produces a clinical picture like trifurcation occlusion, with additional involvement of the internal capsule, leading to hemiplegia and sensory loss affecting the face, hand, arm, and leg.

## Posterior circulation arteries

**Posterior cerebral artery** arises from the basilar artery. The paired posterior cerebral arteries supply the occipital cerebral cortex, medial temporal lobes, posterior portion of the corpus callosum, thalamus, and rostral midbrain. Posterior cerebral artery occlusion typically leads to contralateral homonymous hemianopia, frequently with preservation of macular vision. Compared to visual loss from middle cerebral artery strokes, PCA-related field defects tend to be more prominent in the upper visual field. When the occlusion is near the PCA origin, particularly around the midbrain, ocular motor disturbances may occur, such as vertical gaze palsy, oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) palsy, internuclear ophthalmoplegia and vertical skew deviation. Damage to the dominant hemisphere’s occipital lobe may result in anomic aphasia (marked by difficulty naming objects), alexia without agraphia (where reading is impaired, but writing remains unaffected), visual agnosia (particularly for stimuli in the left visual field, due to corpus callosum involvement, disconnecting the right visual cortex from language centers in the left hemisphere). If both posterior cerebral arteries are affected, the patient may present with cortical blindness, memory deficits linked to temporal lobe injury, prosopagnosia (the inability to recognize familiar faces) and a range of visual-perceptual and behavioral disturbances.
