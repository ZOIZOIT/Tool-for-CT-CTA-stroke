A variety of different web development tools and frameworks were utilised in this project in order to build the OCT educational application. The core framework picked was Next.js because of its efficient page-based routing, performance optimisations. MDX was also implemented to allow the integration of Markdown with JSX. The AriaDocs template provided pre-built components and styling for structured documentation pages. The application uses CSS Modules to manage consistent styling and design responsiveness. Finally, the application is hosted on Vercel, a cloud platform optimised for Next.js applications.
