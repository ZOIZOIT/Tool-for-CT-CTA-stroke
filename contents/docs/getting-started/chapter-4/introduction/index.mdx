According to the American Stroke Association ischemic strokes account for about 87% of all strokes. Ischemic strokes occur because of obstruction of vessels that supplies blood to the brain. [1] The pathogenetic mechanisms that can produce ischemic stroke are thrombosis and embolism. The distinction between them can be very difficult or impossible to make.

Blood flow interruption leads to an environment of glucose and oxygen deprivation for neurons, glia and vascular cells. The lack of glucose and oxygen causes ATP levels to fall and finally to energy failure which is more intense in the ischemic core compared to the surrounding penumbra. Without reperfusion, even the help of glycolysis is not enough to balance the energy deprivation. Energy failure also affects the balance of transmembrane ions. Loss of ion gradients (especially K+/Na+) causes neuron and astrocyte depolarization. This results to additional energy consumption and may extend the infarct. Calcium dysregulation affects mitochondrial function and therefore mobilizes cell death pathways. Additionally, oxidative and nitrosative compounds which are causing some of the toxic results of ischemia, as well as excitotoxicity (neurotoxic effects of excitatory neurotransmitters, especially glutamate) may be present. As a result, cell death cascades begin. Cell death is more intense and fast in the infarct core (necrosis) compared to the penumbra (apoptosis) and during reperfusion. Ischemia also triggers an inflammatory response.

In case the blood flow is not quickly restored, ischemic death of brain tissue begins to occur. The infarction area within the ischemic core is typically supplied by less than 20% of the normal flow. [3] Incomplete ischemia tends to show prolonged cell survival rates. This happens because ,for example, in cases with an existing 20%-40% of normal blood flow ( ischemic border zone – penumbra), cell damage is more likely to be reversible. Reperfusion is a prerequisite for cell damage reversal and, if not achieved, reversibly damaged cells begin to die as well. The penumbra surrounds the core, has moderately reduced perfusion and cells here are still viable for some time with proper reperfusion. Death of penumbral tissue is associated with a worse clinical outcome.

The severity of ischemia can create and determine specific patterns of cell death. Mild ischemia –for example in cardiac arrest with rapid restoration of blood flow- leads to _neuronal vulnerability_ that is selectively restricted to certain neuronal populations. In more severe cases of ischemia, selective **neuronal necrosis** causes the death of most or even all affected neurons, but not the death of glia and vascular cells. Cases such as a stroke without restoration of the blood flow result to complete permanent ischemia. Complete permanent ischemia affects all types of brain cells by causing **pannecrosis**. As a result, it leaves behind chronic cavitary lesions.

After an ischemic stroke, edema starts forming within hours. Cytotoxic edema begins almost immediately and vasogenic edema follows. The next few days (2 to 3 days) edema reaches its peak volume, which may be of such severity that it leads to compression of adjacent structures, herniation and death.
