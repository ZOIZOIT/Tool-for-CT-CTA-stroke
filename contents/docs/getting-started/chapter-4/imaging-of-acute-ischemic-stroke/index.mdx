title: Imaging of Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS)
---

All patients with suspected acute stroke should undergo emergency brain imaging upon arrival at the hospital, prior to starting any specific treatment for acute ischemic stroke (AIS). A CT scan or MRI should be obtained routinely, to distinguish between ischemic stroke and hemorrhage or to determine other potential pathologies (such as a tumor), that can mimic stroke, and to localize the lesion. Non-contrast CT is widely available, fast, easy to perform and can also distinguish between ischemia and hemorrhage. That’s why is usually preferred for initial diagnosis. In most cases NCCT can provide all the information needed for acute management. However, it has sensitivity limitations within the first 6 hours. MRI is more suitable compared to CT scan for demonstrating early ischemic infarcts. It can also show ischemic strokes in the brainstem or cerebellum and detect thrombotic occlusion of venous sinuses.

The explanation of the limitations mentioned is that, over the course of minutes to hours, the ischemia-infarction process in the brain leads to progressively increasing edema. CT systems are standardized based on the attenuation coefficient of water, enabling them to detect even minimal increases in brain water content as reductions in tissue attenuation, expressed in Hounsfield units (HU). In the earliest stages of ischemia (within minutes after stroke onset), cytotoxic edema develops; however, since there is no overall water gain at this point, CT attenuation remains unaffected. As time progresses, typically within hours, more discernible changes appear, such as brain tissue swelling or parenchymal hypoattenuation. These findings are attributed to ongoing ionic edema and a net increase in tissue water content.

Systems should be organized to ensure that brain imaging is performed as rapidly as possible in patients who may be eligible for IV thrombolysis, mechanical thrombectomy, or both. The primary purpose of imaging in cases where AIS is suspected is to support the clinician in both verifying the diagnosis and determining the most suitable treatment strategy. In patients who may be candidates for IV thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy or both, brain imaging should be done as quickly as possible. This process must occur swiftly, aiming for a door-to-imaging duration under 20 minutes and imaging interpretation within 45 minutes. [31][30] That’s why systems should be established so that at least half of the patients that may be eligible for thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy can undergo brain imaging within 20 minutes of the arrival in the ED.

The effectiveness of IV alteplase is time dependent, with earlier use within the approved therapeutic window resulting in greater relative advantages. To maximize access to mechanical thrombectomy for eligible patients arriving within the 6- to 24-hour timeframe, prompt assessment and intervention remain essential. Shortening the duration from emergency department arrival to initial neuroimaging can contribute significantly to earlier treatment administration. Research indicates that average or median door-to-imaging times of 20 minutes or less are attainable across various types of hospital environments.

NCCT as well as MRI are effective to exclude ICH before IV alteplase administration. NCCT is sufficient neuroimaging for decisions about IV alteplase in most patients and when performed immediately, it provides high value for patients with acute stroke. CTA with CTP or MR angiography (MRA) with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) with or without MR perfusion is recommended for certain cases. MRI is equally accurate to NCCT for the detection of hyperacute intraparenchymal hemorrhage in cases where patients present with stroke symptoms within 6 hours of onset when gradient echo sequences are used. In cases where the patient awakes with stroke or time of onset cannot be accurately defined (>4,5 hours), MRI helps to choose those who can benefit from IV alteplase within 4.5 hours of stroke symptoms recognition. CTA with CTP is useful for selecting candidates for mechanical thrombectomy between 6 and 24 hours after last known well. For patients who otherwise meet criteria for endovascular therapy (EVT) a CTA is recommended during the initial evaluation but without delaying IV thrombolysis if indicated.

Concerning IV alteplase eligibility, someone should always remember that in patients qualified for IV alteplase the benefit of therapy is time dependent. Administration of thrombolytic should not wait to perform an MRI to exclude cerebral microbleeds (CMBs). In general, additional multimodal neuroimaging, such as CT and MRI perfusion imaging, is not recommended in such cases, as NCCT is already sufficient to manage acute treatment and their performance may delay alteplase administration. The exception is cases when there is substantial diagnostic uncertainty, therefore, advanced imaging may be beneficial. Also, in patients who awake with stroke symptoms or have unclear time of onset > 4.5 hours from last known well or at baseline state, an MRI can provide needed information (identifying diffusion-positive FLAIR-negative lesions) for selecting the patients who can benefit from IV thrombolysis within 4.5 hours of symptoms onset.

Concerning eligibility for mechanical thrombectomy patients qualified for it, should undergo a noninvasive vessel imaging during the initial imaging evaluation according to the recommendations, as already mentioned. If there is no renal impairment, CTA is a better and faster option and can be performed before obtaining a serum creatinine concentration without any delay during waiting for the laboratory results. This is a safe choice because the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy secondary to CTA imaging for patients with normal renal function is not high. In cases of large vessel occlusion (LVO) with no noninvasive vessel imaging during the initial evaluation, noninvasive vessel imaging should be performed as quickly as possible even during alteplase infusion. In such cases, CTA has greater accuracy than MRA. In addition to the intracranial circulation, imaging of the extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries is helpful to identify potential dissections, stenoses, and occlusions needed to plan the endovascular procedure or even identify patient's ineligible for treatment. Identifying the collateral flow status of the patient is also very important to make decisions about the treatment and the potential thrombectomy eligibility. Multiphase CTA can be useful to show moderate to good collateral circulation that can make a patient qualified for mechanical thrombectomy up to 12 hours from onset. [42] It is very important to remember that advanced imaging should not delay door–to–groin puncture times.

Each imaging method has some advantages and disadvantages that lead to a particular choice according to the guidelines.

## Non-contrast computed tomography NCCT

NCCT can show early signs of ischemia with sensitivity 31% for the first 3 hours and 82% for 6 hours. [5] Early CT signs of ischemia include: hypoattenuating brain tissue, obscuration of lentiform nucleus, dense MCA sign, insular ribbon sign and sulcal effacement.

**Hypo attenuating brain tissue** is the result of cytotoxic edema that occurs due to ion pumps failure and ATP deprivation. An increase of brain water content by 1% will result in a CT attenuation decrease of 2.5 HU. [43] Hypoattenuation on NCCT has high specificity for irreversible brain damage due to ischemia if it is detected within first 6 hours. The identification of this sign during early stroke can be difficult. Absence of hypodensity in the image is a good sign with better potentials for a favorable outcome. On the contrary early detection of hypoattenuation in the first six hours is usually followed by larger infarct volumes, more severe symptoms, less favorable clinical courses and higher risk of hemorrhage.

and white matter. In the right hemisphere there is hypoattenuating brain tissue that

**Obscuration of the lentiform nucleus or loss of basal ganglia** is one of the earliest (in some cases it can be seen even 1 hour after clinical onset) and most frequent signs seen in MCA infraction. The basal ganglia are typically almost always involved in MCA infraction and that’s why this sign is also called blurred basal ganglia or loss of basal ganglia sign. [43] It is defined as decreased attenuation involving the lentiform nucleus and loss of the accurate delineation of this area. [49] Typically, loss of outline of the basal ganglia can be clearly visible when comparing symptomatic and contralateral sides. M1 segment of MCA supplies the lentiform nucleus without collateral flow from cortical anastomoses, thus this sign is seen in patient with occlusion in M1 or ICA. However, if the infarction had been in more distal part of the MCA or in other arteries, CT may not show any change at the basal ganglia at all.

_Figure 4.2: Obstruction of the lentiform nucleus. (a) Initial NCCT 2 hours after
clinical presentation showed loss of right basal ganglia outline (arrow) compared
with normal outlined left basal ganglia. (b) Repeat NCCT one day later showed more
conspicuous hypodensity at the right basal ganglia region. (Image used with permission

**Insular Ribbon sign or loss of insular ribbon sign** is defined as decreased precision in delineation of gray-white matter interface at lateral margin of insula [49] and refers to hypodensity and swelling of the insular cortex, a region sensitive to ischemia due to its poor collateral flow .It is an early and very common (75-100% present [50]) CT-sign of infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery and needs careful evaluation because it can easily be confused with herpes encephalitis. In occlusion of MCA (or internal carotid artery), with cessation of flow, the insular ribbon becomes the region most distal from the anterior and posterior cerebral collateral circulation. As a result, the area seems to become a watershed arterial zone. [50] This sign is not common to appear as a sole AIS sign in NCCT and patients with it usually have obscuration of basal ganglia and effacement of the hemispherical sulcus.

at right insular region (arrow) compared the normal insular at the left side. (Loss
of basal ganglia outline and effacement of the adjacent cortical sulci are also present).

**Dense MCA sign** is a result of occlusion in the MCA. It is also seen on CT-angiography. The hyperdense MCA sign is known for its high specificity and positive predictive value in indicating thromboembolic occlusion of the MCA. It correlates with severe neurological impairment, widespread brain injury, and unfavorable clinical prognosis. [48] This sign on CT is seen as hyperattenuating MCA vessel with attenuation higher than that in any other visualized artery or vein.[49] Typically MCA attenuation is abnormal presenting as more than 43HU and the ratio dense MCA/normal appearing vessel is higher than 1.2 in AIS. [51] Careful evaluation of dense MCA sign is essential as there are some cases that may also result to hyperdense MCA. Patients with raised hematocrit may have this sign.

MCA (arrow). (b) CTA showing right MCA occlusion (arrow). (Image used with permission

Hyperdensity of the distal MCA and its branches seen in the lateral sulcus (sylvian fissure) is called MC**A dot sign** and is more likely to represent embolic material.

similar to brain tissue. (d) CTA shows thrombosis within the MCA. (e, f) Repeat NCCT
5 months later with normal density of distal right MCA which is almost similar to
brain parenchyma and proximal part of the vessel (arrow). Volume loss due to previous
insult is present. (Image used with permission form Radhiana H.)_

**Sulcal effacement** is defined as decreased contrast, loss of accurate borders of the gray white interface and cortical sulci corresponding to localized mass effect. It indicates cortical ischemia and, when presented as a sole sign, it is a good indicator for intravenous thrombolysis.

## Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS)

The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (ASPECTS) is a 10-point semiquantitative topographic scoring system used for the assessment of EICs on NCCT in patients with acute ischemic stroke involving the MCA territory. The extent of early ischemic changes serves as a key predictor of how patients will respond to thrombolysis. Patients who show a small area of hypoattenuation - less than one-third of the MCA territory - on NCCT scans tend to benefit from thrombolytic therapy. However, applying the one-third rule to estimate volume accurately in routine clinical settings is often challenging.

To bring consistency to the detection and reporting of ischemic hypodensity, the ASPECTS system was created. It is a CT-based scoring method that helps identify stroke patients who are unlikely to regain independent function, even with thrombolysis.

ASPECTS uses a topographic, quantitative approach that eliminates the need for physicians to estimate lesion volume from two-dimensional images. The scoring system divides the MCA territory into ten defined regions. These regions are caudate (C), insular ribbon (I), internal capsule (IC), lentiform nucleus (L), anterior inferior frontal cortex (M1), anterior temporal cortex lateral to the insular ribbon (M2), posterior temporal cortex (M3), anterior superior frontal cortex (M4), posterior frontal cortex (M5) and parietal cortex (M6). The M4, M5, M6 are the MCA territories superior to the M1, M2, and M3 regions, respectively.

According to the original formulation 2 representative ganglionic and supraganglionic cuts were inspected. Although currently, it is recommended that all the NCCT slices should be inspected. If any portion of an ASPECTS region is affected, one point is deducted from the maximum score of 10, meaning that lower scores correspond to more extensive infarcts. The abnormality should be visible on a minimum of two consecutive 5-mm thick NCCT slices to confirm it represents a true lesion rather than an artifact caused by partial volume averaging. When early ischemic changes (EICs) are present in both cerebral hemispheres, the ASPECTS should be calculated independently for each hemisphere.

are on the same slice, owing to the CT gantry angulation. (Reproduced with permission

It is important to take into consideration the gantry angle as shown in figure 16. As a result, in axial slices the inferior portion of M5 will appear anterior to the superior portion of M2, with the obliquely oriented Sylvian fissure between them.

The ASPECTS scoring system provides a quick and reproducible way to estimate the extent of ischemic damage in MCA strokes. Although one ASPECTS score may represent a range of infarct sizes, it strongly correlates with infarct volume. Higher ASPECTS scores are associated with better outcomes and lower risk of hemorrhage after reperfusion, making ASPECTS a valuable tool for both clinical decision-making and patient selection in stroke trials. CT acquisition technique, slice thickness, image plane, and window settings are factors that affect the visibility of EICs and potential artifacts. While thinner slices improve detail, 3–5 mm slices are standard due to reduced image noise. Using a narrow window width enhances contrast and improves EIC detection without lowering specificity.

ASPECTS has also some limitations. First, it is primarily designed for anterior circulation thromboembolic strokes and less effective for other stroke types. It is also difficult to assess border zone infarcts with multiple small hypodensities. It also carries the limitations of NCCT itself. Therefore, it is challenging to distinguish acute infarcts from old infarcts. Acute white matter infarcts are also hard to detect, especially in the internal capsule. Finally, some regions near the skull base are affected by imaging artifacts (beam-hardening). ASPECTS requires clear and certain findings to score a region as involved.

A very important piece of information that can be derived from brain imaging is the potential viability of the tissue based on its appearance. To achieve this, it is very important to distinguish the ischemic core from the penumbra as the core represents irreversibly damaged tissue, while the penumbra is at-risk but potentially salvageable tissue. In general, early hypoattenuation indicates extended critical hypoperfusion AIS.

Isolated swelling (sulcal effacement) is highly specific for penumbra with specificity 97%. Hypoattenuation with or without swelling has 56% probability to be penumbra and 43% to be infarct core. The CT attenuation ratio can be used to help penumbra identification. CT attenuation ratio refers to the ratio Ischemic attenuation/Normal attenuation and it is optimal for identifying penumbra when bigger than 0.87. A ratio lower than 0.87 suggests infarct core.

Over the course of minutes to hours, the ischemia-infarction process in the brain leads to progressively increasing edema. CT systems are standardized based on the attenuation coefficient of water, enabling them to detect even minimal increases in brain water content as reductions in tissue attenuation, expressed in Hounsfield units (HU). In the earliest stages of ischemia (within minutes after stroke onset), cytotoxic edema develops; however, since there is no overall water gain at this point, CT attenuation remains unaffected. As time progresses, typically within hours, more discernible changes appear, such as brain tissue swelling or parenchymal hypoattenuation. These findings are attributed to ongoing ionic edema and a net increase in tissue water content. In Figure we can see how the core and penumbra can be identified on a Non-enhanced CT (NECT is the same to NCCT) and a CTP.

Cerebral collateral circulation is a network of vascular channels that keeps supplying blood to the ischemic regions in case of occlusion of the principal vessels. [61][62] Collateral blood network consists of extracranial (external carotid artery branches), and intracranial routes (communicating arteries of the circle of Willis and leptomeningeal collaterals). Good collateral circulation preserves the blood supply to the penumbral area in the acute stage and is associated with higher reperfusion rate, smaller infarct volume, lower rate of hemorrhagic transformation, and better neurological outcome after medical treatment or EVT.

## CT angiography

CTA plays a crucial role in detecting LVO in AIS. It provides information about the presence, site, permeability, and length of vessel occlusion. Additionally, it can help to find underlying pathophysiology of the stroke, including arterial dissection, carotid or intracranial atherosclerosis, carotid web, and intracranial vasculopathy. It is also very important that it provides information about the collateral circulation status, which should not be underappreciated. Knowledge of collateral circulation is valuable and can be useful for the early identification of “rapid progressors” or patients with a high probability of rapid growth of irreversible tissue injury. Finally, CTA evaluating the head and neck vessels provides essential knowledge concerning the access of an intracranial target. This is needed by neurointerventionalists who are planning an endovascular procedure.

Limitations of CTA include lack of ability to distinguish carotid pseudo-occlusion from a carotid terminus occlusion versus tandem proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) atherosclerotic occlusion. Single phase CTA, also, is often timed at peak arterial phase when the contrast may not have yet opacified collateral vessels. This may lead to wrong estimation of collateral blood flow. In such cases multiphase CTA can be used to accurately evaluate the collateral circulation. Several collateral scores on single or multiphase CTA have been described in AIS.

Collaterals need to be compared to contralateral side and based on the comparison are categorized as absent, less, equal, or greater collaterals. The combination and comparison of multiphase CTA compared with CTP-based blood flow measurements determine prediction of final tissue fate and eligibility EVT in the late window.

Advantages of multiphase CTA include improvement of the sensitivity to detect vessel occlusion, the length of clot and potentially the extent of ischemic core. On the other hand, during a typical 3-timepoint multiphase CTA the patient’s head should be rescanned of twice after the initial CTA acquisition, which increases the radiation dose. Additionally, poor hemodynamics may lower the quality of assessment. An even more detailed cerebral vessel imaging can be given by a cerebral angiogram DSA which is an invasive procedure and allows real-time dynamic assessment of flow.

The appearance of a CTA with AIS has some typical characteristics. Vessel occlusion appears as an absence of contrast filling in the artery which forms clear **"cut-off" of contrast**. We already mentioned that **dense MCA sign** and **MCA dot sign** are also present on the NCCT. Advanced CTA signs include **clot meniscus sign**.

Clot meniscus sign is defined as the appearance of meniscoid/edge-like or single- or double-wall contrast channels besides or around insular blood clots. Patients with this sign present have higher thrombus permeability.
