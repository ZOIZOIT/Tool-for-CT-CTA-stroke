Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and long-term disability worldwide, requiring rapid and accurate diagnosis to ensure timely intervention. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 15 million people worldwide suffer a stroke annually. Of these, 5 million die, and another 5 million are left with permanent disabilities, creating significant challenges for families and communities. Stroke is uncommon in people under 40 years but when it occurs, the leading cause is hypertension. Additionally, 8% of children with sickle cell disease suffer a stroke. That explains the word “stroke” which, itself, means that it “strikes people down”.

The most dangerous type of stroke is the rupture of a blood vessel, followed by blockage of an artery which is also dangerous and then stroke due to carotid stenosis. Transient ischemic attacks have the best outcome. Survivors of a stroke can experience loss of vision and/or speech, paralysis and confusion.

The incidence of stroke is decreasing in many developed countries due to better control of high blood pressure and reduced levels of smoking. However, the aging population results to an increase of the absolute number of strokes. Hypertension and smoking are the most significant modifiable risk factors. Out of 10 deaths because of a stroke, four could have been avoided if blood pressure had been regulated. For ages under 65, 40% of deaths from stroke are linked to smoking. Atrial fibrillation, heart failure and heart attack are other important risk factors.

Computed Tomography (CT) and CT Angiography (CTA) play a crucial role in the initial assessment and management of stroke patients, offering essential information on brain parenchyma and vascular status. Despite the importance of these imaging modalities, many healthcare professionals and students face challenges in fully understanding their technical aspects and clinical applications.

In response to this educational gap, this thesis focuses on the development of a digital educational tool designed to enhance learning and comprehension of CT and CTA, specifically in the context of stroke diagnosis and treatment. The tool aims to bridge theoretical knowledge with clinical practice by offering an interactive and accessible resource primarily for students and to a lesser extend to radiographers, and medical professionals.

This introduction outlines the background, purpose, and relevance of the project, highlighting the role of CT-CTA in acute stroke care and the growing need for digital resources in medical education.
