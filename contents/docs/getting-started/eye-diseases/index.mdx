## Introduction

Due to the low scattering in the tissues of the eye, OCT immediately found application in ophthalmology where it has the most applications. Thus characteristics such as changes in the thickness of the retina, corneal tissue and optic nerve are measured, detecting changes in the early stages of eye diseases such as glaucoma. In fact, as it has the ability to distinguish between three corneal tissues, OCT is used as an aid in operations such as PRK and LASIK (refractive surgeries). In general, geometric measurements are made with great precision, which is very useful in ophthalmology. Below we will see OCT images from the eye and what they correspond to. Superficial lesions, intraretinal lesions, deep lesions, and lesions resulting in low reflectance appear as black, optically blank marks on the OCT image.

OCT can show changes in the back of the eye such as detecting fluid within the retinal layers or below the retina, macular holes, diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, as well as evaluating and analyzing structures of the anterior segment such as anterior chamber area, iris volume and thickness. OCT should never be considered as the sole criterion for the diagnosis or treatment of any ophthalmological disease. Certain tissues of the eye exhibit high reflectivity under normal conditions. These are the retinal nerve fibre layer, the internal limiting membrane, and the retinal pigment epithelium. High reflectivity is also a feature of reduced retinal thickness, which occurs in retinal atrophy, and scar tissue. Lesions showing high reflectivity can be superficial, intraretinal, or in the deep retina.

Generally the applications of OCT in the eye are divided into intraretinal and subretinal. Intraretinal includes retinal edema, cystoid edema, cysts, micro-cysts, and macular holes. OCT offers sequential scans that are useful in quantifying intraretinal and subretinal fluids. In subretinal applications is retinal detachment where serous fluid causes elevation of the retinal layers. The image looks like a transparent bubble. OCT shows an optically empty space with or without cells or exudate. In glaucoma nerve losses lead to characteristic structural changes in the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fibre capillary layer. The recognition of topographical changes by the physician is therefore important for the diagnosis of glaucoma and the monitoring of its progression. These topographical changes are observed with OCT. In an OCT image of a retina, the red points represent layers of nerve fibres, the retinal pigment epithelium and the capillaries of the choroid which have the highest reflectivity. Black or blue areas show little reflectivity. These are photoreceptor layer, the choroid and vitreous fluid or blood. The applications in ophthalmology are numerous and it is really important to mention that the operator of the machine plays a big role in the final OCT images.

and diffuse retinal hemorrhages are seen. The right OCT photograph shows cystic spaces
in the retina (white arrows) suggestive of retinal edema. Lower arrows indicate serous
retinal detachment._

Some medical conditions where OCT is most beneficial are listed below, with their corresponding OCT images.

## Retinal Diseases

**Diabetic Retinopathy**: Optical Coherence Tomography detects macular edema, retinal thickening & microaneurysms.

and makes optic nerve damage. Our proposed method automatically segments the main
ACA structures: corneal boundary, iris region, and trabecular-iris contact, for anterior
segment parameter analysis. (Fu, Huazhu & Xu, Yanwu & Wong, Damon & Liu, Jiang &
