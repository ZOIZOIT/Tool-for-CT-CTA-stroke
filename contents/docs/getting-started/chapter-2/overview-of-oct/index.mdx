## Description of the OCT

Optical Coherence Tomography is a type of cross-sectional optical imaging which as previously mentioned is the electromagnetic analogue of ultrasound. It is used in low-coherence near-infrared radiation as a source in a Michelson-like interferometer to produce structural, tomographic images of biological tissues in real time. OCT is based on the physical principle of low coherence interferometry with an image resolution of 1-15 µm and penetration depths of 1-3 mm. As in ultrasound, the measurement of the backscattered radiation from tissues results in a line profile, the so-called A-scan. The 2-D, or B-scan, is obtained by repeating the A-scan process while changing the position of the reference mirror. Alternative combinations of multidimensional lateral A-scans can be combined to produce repeated A-scans at the same position as a function of time, M-scans, while B-scans at a fixed axial depth position, called C-scans, result in 3D datasets volume. The first application of OCT is in eye diseases such as glaucoma and macular edema.

The scans are based on splitting the light beam into a sample and a reference arm by a beam splitter. While the former enters the eye, the latter is directed towards a reference mirror, often mobile. Light directed at the retina penetrates the transparent structures of the eye and is partly absorbed, while a larger part is scattered by the different layers of the retina. The two reference and sample beams are reflected back, interfere and are detected by a photodetector or spectrometer in which we get an image depending on the delay of the beam to the sample. Optical dispersion decreases at longer wavelengths and thus the depth of penetration of the OCT image changes with the light source.

In essence, backscattered radiation is a measure of the refractive index, i.e. the optical discontinuity between different tissues. The tissue thickness is calculated by multiplying the optical delay in the tissue, τ, by the speed of light in the tissue. Thus, the thickness measurement is based on the knowledge of a refractive index of the tissue. Because the light beam is focused into a small spot size, the transverse position of the beam is known with great precision. In OCT images, tissue structures are separated because they have different reflection and scattering optical properties. The two basic technologies-methodologies of OCT are TD-OCT (time domain) and the more widespread spectral domain SD-OCT or FD-OCT (Fourier domain). The A-scan can be recovered using an inverse Fourier transform. The two methods will be discussed below.

The OCT system in the image above consists of an interferometer system and the detection system that includes the filters for acquiring the information. Optical fibres are used in the interferometer for optimal radiation information transfer with few losses.

## TD-OCT, OCT in the Time Domain

As mentioned above, the OCT system includes an interferometer. The system in which the mirror in the reference arm is moved to match the optical path of the reflections in the sample to make the interference is called time-domain OCT (TD-OCT). In the case of TD-OCT, the low-coherence source is continuous with a wide spectrum. The backscattered radiation from the sample tissues with an optical path other than (that imparted by the mirror) the mirror distance will be cut off by the detector due to the low coherence of the source. The radiation in the sample arm is reflected with different time delays depending on the optical properties of the various tissues in the sample.

An A-scan profile is obtained by changing the position of the mirror to achieve interference and signal to the detector. The interference fringe is only detected if the optical path to the interferometer is shorter than the length coherence of the source radiation. Thus, by finding the fringe with the greatest intensity, the position of the object from which the reflected beam originated is determined. As the moving mirror moves at a speed, even constant, a Doppler effect occurs so we have a change in the frequency of the signal.

## FD-OCT, OCT Frequency

OCT in the frequency domain is the most modern form of technology. It has two subcategories SD-OCT and SS-OCT. The spectral domain SD-OCT system has a spectrally broad and continuous source but the mirror in the system remains stationary and the depth information is acquired by processing the interference spectrum. The detector is replaced by a spectrograph so that all frequencies are analyzed simultaneously at the moments when the sample and reference beams meet. The detector system consists of a CCD camera and a diffraction barrier. A Fourier transform is used on the spectrum of the backscattered radiation to extract the depth information in the sample since the interference profiles are different for
different optical path.

## SS-OCT, Source Scanning OCT

In the case of SS-OCT the wavelength-dependent intensity data are not recorded simultaneously using a broad-spectrum source and a spectrograph. Instead they are recorded consecutively by one photodetector while the source frequencies are scanned one at a time. The source has a narrow instantaneous linewidth by scanning the frequencies one by one and is detected by a single photomultiplier receiver as a function of time. The figure below shows the source pulse and the Fourier transform of the interferogram.

## Spatial Analysis of an OCT system

The spatial resolution of an imaging system is defined as the ability to distinguish two points in space. You measure in units of distance, and the higher the spatial resolution, the smaller the distance that can be distinguished. We separate her in axial and transverse resolution.

### Axial analysis

The axial resolution of an OCT system is determined by the coherence length of the source i.e. independent of the beam focusing conditions. It is the depth analysis. The coherence length is equal to the spatial extent of the autocorrelation produced by the interferometer in a TD-OCT image.

### Cross-sectional analysis

The transverse resolution of OCT is determined by the optical components of the system, specifically the ability to focus the beam on the sample. Lenses need to be fitted to the system to properly focus the beam.

### Comparison of TD and FD-OCT

A brief analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of each method will be made. TD-OCT tissue depth is acquired point-by-point by axially moving the reference mirror. Compared to SD-OCT this makes TD-OCT a much slower method in terms of image acquisition speed as no moving parts are needed. The fact that in the role of the detector in SD-OCT we have a spectrograph, allows the detection of the entire wavelength spectrum simultaneously corresponding to reflections from the entire depth with acquisition speeds of 27,000 to 53,000 A-scans per second, compared to a maximum of about 400 of scans per second in TD-OCT. Another advantage offered by the higher speed scanning is that moving objects produced by movements in eye tomography are reduced.

Theoretically the axial range of a TD-OCT system is unlimited since it depends on the length of the reference arm while in SD-OCT and SS-OCT it is limited by the resolution of the spectrograph and the 'monochromatic' frequency range. Of course, FD-OCT techniques have better axial resolution as well as transverse resolution with a TD-OCT system. TD-OCT has constant sensitivity regardless of optical path difference since it works by moving the reference mirror. Also the techniques in the spectrum space need analysis in the separation of the spectrum peaks i.e. better cameras, bigger diffraction barriers and other means.

Of course, SD and SS OCT for small depths have greater sensitivity. SS-OCTs in ophthalmic systems operate at longer wavelengths with lower axial resolution. Its biggest downside is that it is not yet commercially available due to the financial costs.

### Noise in OCT systems

As we perform a measurement with the OCT method, the measured signal will inevitably contain noise. For optimum performance the noise should obviously be as low as possible and the noise sources mitigated. In a system we define some quantities to quantify the noise. These are dynamic range, signal noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity.

The dynamic range of a system is the ratio of the maximum value of a parameter to the minimum measurable value. It is usually expressed in units of decibels where dB=10\*log(x). SNR is defined as the ratio of the maximum signal amplitude to the noise signal amplitude at a given time. Finally the sensitivity will be defined as the minimum input signal needed to produce an output signal with a certain SNR value. In this chapter, noise sources related to the source of electromagnetic radiation, the interferometer and the detectors of the system will be mentioned.

The main source of noise is photon noise. It arises from the quantum mechanical nature of particles due to the statistical variation of the number of photons emitted by the source. When the signal is specific the amount of photon noise is: 𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑡 𝑛𝑜𝑖𝑠𝑒 = √𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑙 . It is clear that the larger the signal, the smaller percentage of the signal is noise, that said, noise is higher when the signal is low.

Inside the interferometer we have several sources of noise such as photon pressure, mechanical vibrations due to movements such as the mirror and vacuum fluctuations due to the quantum nature of the fields. The pressure exerted by the photons of the continuous part of the field impinging on the reference mirror has momentum and is proportional to the total intensity of the radiation. Thus it is a major source of noise in SS-OCT.

In the detector of the system there is a case, in the case of loss of field radiation, due to thermal energy to excite an electron-hole pair in the conduction band. This is how a current is created which we call dark current.

Another interesting problem is the problem of lost frequency and it directly affects the information we receive. We assume that the OCT signal is a three-dimensional distribution of refractive index with spatial frequency spectrum S(f). This spectrum extends from 1/Ro to 1/ro where Ro is the largest continuous structure of the sample that gives a measurement and ro is the smallest. Knowing the physics behind OCT we can image objects whose scattered radiation spatial frequency lies between 2/λ-1/lc to 2/λ+1/lc with lc the coherence length of the source. So there is enough information that is not in this range that internal structures with a smoothly varying refractive index are lost and missing from the OCT image.

Finally we will refer to a source of noise called speckle noise. It degrades the image quality of OCT as it reduces the contrast and makes the boundary separation between highly scattering structures within the tissue difficult to distinguish. As the wave is incident and propagates through the tissue it can be backscattered back towards the detector. Two main processes affect the spatial coherence of the backscattered wave. These are the multiple backscattering of the beam into and out of the desired sample volume and the random delays of the straight propagating and returning beam from the multiple forward scatters. The first process is the main source of speckle noise, but in general both processes modify the shape of the wavefront of the beam returning from the sample creating regions of destructive and enhancing interference which appear as spots on OCT images. Multiple backscatter can occur despite the short matching time of the sources. To form the spots, it is sufficient for two or more scatterers in the sample volume to backscatter waves that arrive at some point of the detector out of phase but within a time interval shorter than the coherence time of the source. In addition, waves originating from different scatterers but separated by an optical path of approximately an integer multiple of half a wavelength can produce speckles, provided that the optical path does not exceed the coherence length of the source. In a similar way the scattered waves from different points of a large particle create speckle noise. The above conditions within the volume of a sample are quite easily met so the generation of speckle noise is high.

### Other OCT Methods

OCT relies on optical differences in tissue properties to differentiate their characteristics. The main source of information to create contrast is the interference of backscattered light. However, any property of matter that leads to a change in radiation characteristics can be used as a source of information and signal. Thus other OCT techniques based on difference phenomena such as polarization, Doppler effect and elasticity were created. Below is a brief review on every technique.

## PS-OCT, Polarising OCT

Various tissues such as muscle contain collagen and elastin that exhibit birefringence when layered. In general highly organized structures are sensitive to specific light polarization. Backscattered light from structures deep in tissue is unpolarised due to multiple scattering and scattering by non-spherical particles. Characterization of the polarization state of backscattered light can reveal information about tissue structure not present using OCT alone. Still having a polarized light source and studying the backscatter can enhance the image contrast between healthy and unhealthy tissue. PS-OCT in addition by changing the polarization helps to distinguish the biochemical composition of a structure so it is also useful spectroscopically as specific substances change the polarization. Changes in molecular type, concentration and organization can be indicative of a variety of pathological conditions making the method a great clinical tool.

## Doppler OCT

For many applications of the OCT method the flow of fluids or moving scatterers within the sample are of particular interest. For example, the distribution of blood flow velocity in a biological tissue can provide additional diagnostic information. The measurement is done by the Doppler shift of the frequency according to the Doppler effect. The moving scatterer will change the frequency of the scattered radiation according to its speed. Doppler OCT measures and maps flow velocity with high spatial resolution. Currently the maximum detection depth of the system is limited to imaging blood vessels near the surface of various organs.

## OCT Elastography

With the OCT elastography technique, mechanical properties of the tissue are measured. The basic idea is that as a tissue is imaged, that tissue is compressed, vibrating, or bending. We assume that if an applied force is small enough, the relative displacement of points on the tissue will be proportional to the force. The force per unit area is called stress. This method exploits the sensitivity of OCT to sample displacements to quantify small deformations within the tissue caused by externally applied stress. In essence, stiffness is measured, the quantitative measure of which is the shear modulus. This varies for different tissues and indeed some diseases alter the modulus of elasticity of the extracellular tissue. Such conditions can be edema and calcification.
