title: Image Quality

The most important acquisition factors that affect the image quality include tube voltage, tube current and rotation time.

**Tube current (mA)** determines the number of electrons, and thus X-ray photons produced per unit time multiplied by rotation time. It’s represented as mAs, which directly affects the photon count in the image. Tube current does not affect the contrast or Hounsfield Unit (HU) values. Concerning image noise, on the other hand, tube current reduces image noise by increasing photon count, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio. Tube current has a linear impact on radiation dose.

** Tube voltage (kVp)** refers to the peak energy of X-ray photons. It influences penetration, contrast, and dose. Voltage changes have a non-linear impact on radiation dose with higher impact. Concerning image contrast, lower tube voltage enhances contrast, especially in contrast-enhanced scans like CTA. Lowering kVp, also increases image noise.

The main advantage of CT in terms of image quality is its’ excellent low-contrast resolution. Low-contrast resolution refers to the sensitivity and ability to detect structures that are characterized by a small difference in signal (in Hounsfield units) compared to their direct environment. It depends on tube voltage, beam filtration and the reconstruction algorithm. The main limitation for this, is the image noise. Ways to reduce the noise include either increasing tube current (mA) a (higher patient exposure), or by increasing the reconstructed slice thickness, (worse spatial resolution).

**Spatial resolution** is a very important parameter of image quality. It refers to the ability to observe contours of small objects within the scanned volume. Small objects are visible only if there is a large difference in signal (Hounsfield units) between them and their direct environment. Contrast resolution refers to the ability to differentiate tissues with similar attenuation, which is important for detecting soft-tissue differences. Finally artifact levels affect the image quality, by distorting it due to potential motion, beam hardening and other factors.
