title: Radiation Protection

The fundamental principles of radiation protection are Justification, Optimization, and Dose Limitation.

**Justification** principle refers to the necessity of having a clear clinician benefit from any decision that includes exposure to radiation. Concerning a CT scan, it should be performed only when it is medically necessary, and the benefits outweigh the risks. It should be performed only when indicated and unnecessary or duplicate scans should be avoided. In case a CT scan provides diagnostic value that can be equally or better achieved with another form of imaging that does not use ionizing radiation (such as MRI) the alternative should be preferred.

**Optimization** principle is often summarized by the acronym ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable). This means that radiation should be kept at the lowest possible levels in order to achieve sufficient image quality for diagnosis. This can be achieved by using the lowest effective dose, adjusting protocols individual characteristics of the patient and the pathology, collimating the beam to limit exposure and applying automatic exposure control (tube current modulation). For CT that means that choosing the best possible image quality by increasing dose is not an optimal choice. Dose should be limited to the level in which image quality is good enough to provide diagnostic information.

**Dose limitation** principle mainly refers to occupational and public exposure, not patients. Workers and public should not receive doses that exceed the recommended safety thresholds.

It is important to mention that special categories of patients should be carefully taken into consideration when deciding an imaging method. Such categories are pediatric patients and pregnant women (possible pregnancy should be disclosed).

To sum up with, 10 Pearls for radiation protection of patients in CT include:

1. Perform it only when indicated
2. Prefer non ionizing alternatives when possible
3. Check for pregnancy
4. Use the image quality only needed for diagnostic purposes
5. Use specific protocols
6. Do not perform multiple pass or phase CT routinely
7. Adjust exposure parameters individually
8. Know your equipment
9. Use good technique
10. Pay attention to radiation dose values and compare with diagnostic reference levels (DRLs)
