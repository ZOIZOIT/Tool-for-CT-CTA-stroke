title: The Image System
---

A CT imaging system consists of the **gantry and the table**. All the system components necessary for capturing transmission profiles of the patient are in the gantry. To obtain these profiles from various angles, the components are installed on a rotating support structure within the gantry. This structure includes the X-ray tube along with the high voltage generator and tube cooling system, the collimator, beam shaping filters, the detector arc, and the data acquisition system. These parts must be able to endure significant centrifugal forces generated by the rapid rotation of the gantry. When rotation times approach 0.25 seconds, forces equivalent to several tens of g can be produced. Therefore, engineering these parts is highly complex.

Like the gantry, the design and engineering of the table are vital for ensuring accurate data acquisition at high rotational speeds. The table must support considerable weight without bending. The patient may be positioned on the table either head-first or feet-first, and either in a supine or prone posture; this positioning is usually documented along with the scan data.

## The Gantry

The **X ray tube** is the place where X rays are produced. It consists of an electron source from a heated tungsten filament with a focusing cup, serving as the tube cathode, an anode or target and a tube envelope which is needed to maintain interior vacuum. There are two main circuits, the filament circuit and the tube voltage circuit.

Initially, concerning cathode, the filament current causes the filament to heat up leading to thermionic emission of electrons, which then flow from cathode to anode due to the accelerating potential difference applied between them. The tungsten wire is 0.2 to 0.3 mm diameter and operates at around 2700o K. It is highly important that the filament stays in lower temperatures outside exposure times, to keep evaporation of tungsten as low as possible. At high anode voltages, all electrons emitted from the filament are fully accelerated toward the anode, resulting in an anode current that remains largely unaffected by changes in tube voltage. This is known as the saturation current.

Concerning **anode**, the choice of the material is highly important. A high Bremsstrahlung yield is essential, which necessitates the use of materials with high atomic numbers (Z). It is also crucial to consider thermal properties, such as maximum useful temperature (influenced by melting point and vapor pressure), thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, and density. As already mentioned, Tungsten has favorable thermal properties but also a high Z=74, which make it the optimum choice. To prevent overheating, the anode rotates, driven by an induction motor, and the entire tube insert is immersed in a liquid cooling medium (transformer oil). When electrons strike the anode target, most of their energy is transformed into heat, with only a small portion converted into X-rays. The rotation of the anode spreads the heat over a larger area, allowing different sections to absorb the thermal load continuously. The most intense and clinically useful portion of the X-ray beam exits the tube, while unwanted radiation emitted in other directions is absorbed by the surrounding tube housing.

The **tube envelope** also provides radiation shielding to prevent any radiation except the primary beam from leaving the housing. That is achieved with the help of lead sheets by which the housing is lined, that minimize leakage radiation.

The specific area on the anode target where the electron beam from the cathode strikes is called focal spot. Actual focal spot size depends on the width of the electron beam, which increases with filament size and tube current (mA). The **line focus principle** describes how the effective focal spot size is determined by the actual focal spot size and the anode angle, following the formula:

_Effective focal spot size = Actual focal spot size × sin(anode angle)_

To balance resolution and exposure needs, most X-ray tubes use two deferent filaments. Large filament creates a larger focal spot, offering lower spatial resolution but shorter exposure times due to higher X-ray output. Small filament produces a smaller focal spot for higher resolution, but with longer exposure times and reduced X-ray output.

X-rays are produced slightly beneath the surface of the anode, not directly on it. Those emitted toward the heel (anode side) must pass through more anode material, resulting in reduced intensity compared to those directed toward the cathode side. This variation in intensity across the beam is known as the anode **heel effect**.

After the X ray tube (with a rotating tungsten anode) and a high voltage generator are used for generating the x ray beam, **collimators** are used to create the “dose slice” (or “cone”) shape of the beam. The X-ray beam is commonly described as a fan beam when its width along the longitudinal axis is narrow. In contrast, for multi-slice CT scanners, where the longitudinal beam width is significantly larger, the beam is typically referred to as a cone beam

Beam **shaping filters**, (“bow-tie” filters), are positioned near the X-ray tube and are designed to create a gradient in X-ray beam intensity. Their main purposes are to: limit the dynamic range of signals detected by the CT detector, reduce radiation dose to the patient's peripheral regions and minimize beam hardening effects, helping improve calibration and image quality.

The **CT detectors** used nowadays are solid state detectors, typically scintillators (the photons interact with the detector and emit light). A CT detector should have good detection efficiency, fast response and good transparency for the generated light. The size of detector elements and the angular separation of the projection determine image resolution in the reconstructed images. Multi-slice CT scanners are classified by either the number of detector rows or the number of data slices they acquire per rotation. Multi-row scanners enable thinner slices, improving longitudinal spatial resolution and allow longer and faster scan volumes. High-end CT systems, such as 320-detector-row scanners, can capture up to 160 mm of anatomy in one rotation, making them ideal for full-organ imaging (e.g., brain, heart) in a single scan.
