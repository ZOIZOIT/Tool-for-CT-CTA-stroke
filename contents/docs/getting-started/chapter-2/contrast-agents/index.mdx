title: Contrast Agents

Contrast agents are substances specifically used to increase the contrast between the target tissue and surrounding tissues. A lot of different kinds of contrast agents exist including oral (barium sulphate), intravenous (iodine-based and gadolinium-based agents), enemas (barium sulphate), spinal injection (non-ionic iodine-based contrast agents) and gases known as negative contrast agents (air, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide). CT scans mainly use iodine-based contrast agents intravenously.

**Contrast phases** are different stages of contrast enhancement to blood vessels, following the introduction of the contrast agent. These phases include:

**Early arterial phase**: It takes place 15-25 seconds from injection. In this phase contrast is still in the arteries and has not arrived at the organs and other soft tissues.

**Late arterial phase**: It takes place 30-40 seconds from injection. In this phase there is an optimal enhancement of tissues and organs supplied directly from the arterial system (e.g. pancreas, spleen).

**Portal venous phase**: It takes places 70-90 seconds from the injection. In this phase portal vein and hepatic veins are completely enhanced (it is also called hepatic phase). It is characteristic that liver parenchyma reaches its peak enhancement.

**Nephrogenic phase**: It takes place 85-120 seconds from injection. In this phase contrast agent is being filtered in the kidneys and therefore is good to show renal pathology.

**Excretory phase**: It takes place 5-10 minutes after injection. In this phase contrast agent is excreted into the renal collecting system.

In the central nervous system (CNS), the blood-brain barrier (BBB) restricts the movement of contrast agents into brain tissue. However, in many CNS disorders, the BBB becomes compromised, allowing contrast agents to accumulate in affected areas. The use of contrast agent in stroke diagnosis and evaluation is used for CTA imaging. CTA is performed using the arterial phase of intravascular contrast. This phase shows the contrast perfusing through the major arteries, such as the aortic arch and cerebral arteries. The nephrogenic phase also, provides information about collateral vessels and the extent of the penumbra, which shows tissue at risk. Cerebral CT angiography (CTA) is performed to visualize the full patency of the brain's arteries using contrast enhancement. Accurate scan timing is crucial to achieve optimal arterial opacification and to minimize venous contamination.

Contrast agents are in general safe drugs, but there are of course possible side effects and contraindications. Side effects include allergies, contrast induced acute kidney injury, contrast induced neurotoxicity and for iodinated contrast agents contrast induced thyrotoxicosis. Thatâ€™s why, contraindications for contrast agents include a known allergy or hypersensitivity and a history of severe reactions to contrast agents, certain thyroid disorders, pregnancy and kidney impairment.
