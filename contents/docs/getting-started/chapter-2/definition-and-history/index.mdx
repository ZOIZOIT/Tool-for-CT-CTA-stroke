Computed tomography (CT) is a computerized x-ray technique where an x-ray beam rotates quickly around the patient to measure X-ray attenuations by different tissues inside the body. CT scanners use a rotating X-ray tube, and a row of detectors placed in a gantry capturing data that the computer processes using tomographic reconstruction algorithms to create cross-sectional images, known as “slices.” These tomographic slices provide clinicians with more detailed information compared to standard x-rays. When multiple consecutive slices are combined digitally, they form a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the patient, facilitating clearer visualization of anatomical structures and potential abnormalities like tumors.

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is a CT-based imaging method designed to visualize arteries and veins across the body. By injecting contrast agent into the blood vessels, CTA produces images that help detect blockages, aneurysms, dissections, and stenosis.

The foundation of computed tomography (CT) dates to 1895 when Wilhelm Röntgen discovered X-rays and their ability to penetrate matter. In 1917, Johann Radon mathematically solved the problem of reconstructing a function from its line integrals, laying the theoretical groundwork for CT, though his work was not widely recognized until the mid-20th century due to its complexity and being published in German. The practical development of CT was driven in the 1960s and 1970s by Allan Cormack, who developed reconstruction algorithms, and Godfrey Hounsfield, who built the first operational and commercial CT scanners; both received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1979. CT scanner technology evolved through four generations, differing mainly in X-ray source and detector design as well as their movement patterns. The first generation used a single pencil beam and detector with linear and rotational movement, the second employed a narrow fan beam and a small detector array requiring linear shifts, the third featured a wide fan beam and longer detector array eliminating linear motion and speeding acquisition, and the fourth retained the rotating fan beam but replaced the moving detector with a stationary ring of detectors surrounding the patient.
