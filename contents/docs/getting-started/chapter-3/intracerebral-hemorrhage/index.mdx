title: Intracerebral Hemorrhage
---

Intracerebral hemorrhage is a primary, usually spontaneous (non-traumatic) bleeding occurring in the brain parenchyma causing 10–20% of all strokes worldwide and is the deadliest type of stroke. It may also occur because of trauma (traumatic ICH), but not as usually as the non-traumatic. ICH is associated with serious outcomes, including a 30-day mortality rate of up to 40% and a 1- year mortality rate up to 60% [9]. A high number of patients die in-hospital. The most important risk factor is hypertension, and this may be an explanation to the fact that the incidence is lower in white people than in other groups [6]. Spontaneous ICH is typically caused by chronic, progressive small vessel disease, most often associated with chronic hypertension and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Less common etiologies include hemorrhagic conversion of ischemic stroke, aneurysms, cerebral arteriovenous malformation, vasculitis or vasculopathy, tumor and other etiologies.

## Risk Factors

The most important risk factors for ICH are:

- **Hypertension**: Hypertension is the most important modifiable factor related to high risk of ICH. Poor control of blood pressure also increases the risk of recurrent ICH. Systolic blood pressure above 160 mmHg is associated with larger initial hematoma volume, a higher risk of hematoma expansion and poor functional outcome. This happens due to rupture and continuous bleeding from small cerebral blood vessels.
- **Diabetes**: Diabetes increases the risk of vascular disease and therefore increases the ICH risk.
- **Cholesterol levels**: Hypercholesterolemia has a protective effect against the risk of ICH, something, that does not happen with the ischemic stroke and the mechanism of which is not yet clearly understood.
- **Anticoagulant treatment**: Oral antithrombotic drugs increase initial hematoma volume and the risk of hematoma expansion by 6.2 times expansion.
- **Increased age**: Older people are more likely to suffer an ICH.
- **Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA)**: Frequently affects elderly patients and typically these bleedings arise from the cortico-subcortical brain regions. CAA accounts for a big amount of all spontaneous ICH cases (approximately 20%).
- **Alcohol intake**: The association with ICH is dose dependent.
- **Smoking**: Smoking increases the ICH risk.
- **Drugs abuse**: Cocaine, methamphetamine as well as other illicit drugs are an important risk factor for ICH, especially in young adults.
- **Genetics**: The Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is strongly associated with ICH.
- **Ethnicity**: Asian populations’ ICH incidence tends to be higher.

To sum up with, the most important risk factors of ICH are hypertension, cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), oral anticoagulant treatment and older age. Additional risk factors include cigarette smoking, excessive alcohol or drugs consumption, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, genetics (Apolipoprotein E gene), and ethnicity (Asian ethnicity).

ICH may destroy or compress brain tissue and lead to symptoms. Such cases, compared to the ischemic ones, usually cause more severe headache and depression of consciousness as well as neurologic deficits that do not correspond to the distribution of any single blood vessel. The presence of ICH might be implied by symptoms and signs such as decreased level of consciousness, vomiting, headache, seizures and very high blood pressure. However, none of them is specific enough to distinguish hemorrhagic from ischemic stroke. As a result, diagnosis of ICH must always rely on neuroimaging.

## Neuroimaging Of ICH

### Non-contrast computed tomography NCCT

A CT imaging method without the use of a contrast agent, also known as NCCT, is the gold standard for ICH diagnosis in the emergency department (ED). The reason is the fact that NCCT is a widely available and fast technique with very high sensitivity that can also provide much more useful information such as the location of ICH, the location and the shape of a possible hematoma, the existence of intraventricular extension or hydrocephalus and the presence and degree of edema. It can also disclose midline shift or brainstem compression secondary to the mass effect from the hematoma and reveals a lot of typical image characteristics and signs of ICH. [

NCCT images can provide information of major importance some of which are neuroimaging predictors for many aspects of the ICH such as hematoma expansion, outcome and mortality.

ICH volume is a strong predictor of hematoma expansion, ICH outcome and 30-day mortality with sensitivity 96% and specificity 98% [22]. It can be rapidly estimated in the ED with the ABC/2 technique, which is explained in figure 3-1. Generally, ICH Volume in combination with the initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, is a powerful and easy-to-use predictor. Hematoma volume more than 30 ml is associated with poor outcome, whereas a 10 ml or less volume is more likely to lead to a favorable functional outcome and has less probability of hematoma expansion

**ICH shape and density** are predictors of hematoma expansion with sensitivity 69%,
specificity 46% for the shape and sensitivity 44%, specificity 72% for the density [23]. Heterogenous/ irregular hematomas are associated with increased risk of expansion during the first 24 h of onset and are also linked to more severe perihematomal edema with larger volume compared to homogenous/regular-shaped hematomas.

**Hematoma location** also is of major importance, as each region may affect the outcome in a unique way. Hematoma volume is also sometimes associated with hematoma location. Baseline hematoma volume for lobar ICH tends to be much larger compared to deep ICH [25]. Also, hematoma expansion is less likely to be present in lobar ICH compared to deep ICH. Lobar hemorrhages are usually caused by CAA and are characterized by subarachnoid extension and finger-like projections on NCCT images.

**Hematoma expansion** occurs mostly in the first 0-6 hours after onset, and it is important to consider early follow-up NCCT in case of early interventions needed. Early expansion is modifiable predictor of poor outcome.

**Intraventricular hemorrhage extension and hydrocephalus** present in 45% of ICH cases [9], with the highest frequency for thalamic and caudate bleedings. Blood presence in the ventricles may obstruct the flow of cerebrospinal fluid or impair its resorption leading to hydrocephalus. IVH is related to pre-hospital loss of consciousness and is a predictor of poor outcome.

**Perihematomal edema (PHE)** is a predictor for hematoma expansion and outcome. PHE increases rapidly within the first 24 hours and continues its rapid raise for the first 3 days after the incident. It reaches its peak at days 4-5 and then for the next few days (until day 14) stays gradually elevated. PHE is an independent prognostic factor for death or dependency. Lower attenuation values at 72 h after onset imply a more intense PHE and are predictive of a poor outcome. The mean distance between the hematoma border and the outer border of the edema is called the edema extension distance.

PHE begins as a vasogenic edema that forms because of a cascade of events that leads to blood–brain barrier disruption. What happens here is that the perihematomal space suffers from factors that increase the oncotic pressure. Breakdown products and components of extravasated blood of the hematoma are infiltrated, inflammation occurs as well as thrombin cascade and erythrocyte lysis products are present.

Vasogenic edema itself induces oxidative stress and production of cytotoxin substances which then lead to secondary cytotoxic edema. Increased intracranial pressure can tamponade of the active bleeding but can also cause brain herniation and death.

Although ICH typically appears as a hyperintense hematoma, hyperacute ICH may initially be iso-attenuating to gray matter and increase within minutes to the hyperintense state that can persist for hours to days. The next stage is the subacute stage (it can last days to weeks) in which the attenuation gradually decreases to be iso-attenuating to white matter. Finally, the attenuation decreases even more to be hypoattenuating in the chronic state (lasts weeks to months). Figure 3-3 illustrates the hematoma attenuation over time.

_Figure 3.3: Hematoma attenuation over time (left panel). Minutes after onset the
hematoma is iso-attenuating with gray matter (hyperacute phase). Within the next
hour and with several hours' duration, the typical hyperattenuating image appears,
because the attenuation in the hematoma increases rapidly (acute phase).Over the
next days, the attenuation progressively decreases to iso-attenuating with the gray
or white matter (subacute phase), and then - typically within weeks of onset- it
decreases even more to become hypoattenuating (chronic phase).Ultimately, the hematoma
is absorbed, leaving behind a lesion healed with substance loss and gliosis in the
surrounding brain parenchyma (gliosis). (Licensed under CC BY 4.0)_

NCCT and CTA images can reveal signs of ICH that are considered specific markers and are correlated with the risk of hematoma expansion and prognosis. These signs along with some hemorrhage and hematoma characteristics on the image are the most important neuroimaging predictors of ICH outcome.

The presence of areas of hypo-attenuation or iso-attenuation within the hyper-attenuated ICH on NCCT images forms the **“swirl sign”** (fig.3-4a) and shows active bleeding within the hematoma. The swirl sign is a prognosis indicator associated with larger hematoma size, higher frequency of midline shift, IVH extension, and hematoma expansion [10][11]. It is also a hematoma expansion predictor with 45% sensitivity and 79% specificity

The next important sign is the **“black hole sign”** (fig.3-4b), a round or oval shaped area of hypoattenuation within the hyperattenuating hematoma. This area is enclosed and surrounded by the hematoma and shows no connection to the surrounding brain tissue on the image. The density difference between the hypo and hyper-attenuated area typically is at least 28 Hounsfield units [14]. Black hole sign reveals bleeding of different ages, which is a direct conclusion of the presence of mixed density and attenuation within the same hematoma. This suggests that bleeding has occurred at several timepoints and is therefore predictive of hematoma expansion [13]. The black hole sign predicts hematoma expansion with a 30% sensitivity and 91% specificity

Continuing we have the **“blend sign”** (fig.3-4c) which is a both hyper-attenuated and hypo-attenuated area within the hemorrhage but in a mixed way, without delineable boundaries. This sign is not only associated with hematoma expansion and poor outcome, but also with higher possibility of postoperative rebleeding in cases that minimally invasive neurosurgery is used [18]. It is also associated with Spot Sign (it is going to be mentioned later as a CTA sign) and predicts post ICH secondary neurological deterioration [17]. Blend sing was recently defined, 10 years ago in 2015 by Li et al. [16]. It predicts hematoma expansion with a sensitivity of 28% and specificity of 92%

Another recently defined sign also by Li et al. in 2017 is the **“island sign”** (fig. 3-4d). This is represented in the image as three or more small oval or round hematomas scattered and all completely separate from the main hematoma or four or more small bubble-like or sprout-like - not lobulated - hematomas, which could be connected with the main hematoma (some of them or even all of them)[9]. This sign is associated with multiple bleeding sources, possibly because of shear force or the initial hematoma that causes injuries to the arterioles of the area. The island sign predicts hematoma expansion with an extremely high specificity of 98,2% and a sensitivity of 44,7%

Finally, the **“satellite sign”** (fig. 3-4e) is any small hemorrhage presented sole with 1–20 mm distance from the main hematoma. This sign can predict hematoma expansion with 54% in sensitivity and 94% specificity

### CT angiography

CT angiography (CTA) is a valuable diagnostic tool in the acute evaluation of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). It is widely accessible as a non-invasive method for identifying vascular abnormalities as secondary causes of ICH. In cases of lobar hemorrhage, significant intraventricular extension, young age of patients, or absence of classic cerebrovascular risk factors, the possibility of underlying vascular malformations or other intracranial pathologies should be considered as the possible cause of ICH. Prompt identification of these lesions is essential, as the influence and therefore the impact of quick detection of these lesions on patient management is significant. Although CTA serves as an excellent initial non-invasive screening technique, digital subtraction angiography (DSA) remains the diagnostic gold standard and is often essential for endovascular treatment of cerebral vascular abnormalities following the diagnosis of the stroke. The primary limitations of CTA are its cost and radiation exposure

The presence of one or more focal enhancements within an acute parenchymal hematoma on CTA is called **“spot sign”** (fig. 3-4f and 3-5). This sign is an area of active contrast extravasation and indicates active bleeding into the hematoma. A positive spot sign is a robust predictor of hematoma expansion and poor outcome in supratentorial ICH. It is usually visible within the first 3 hours of symptoms onset. Its presence on the initial CTA has been associated with larger hematoma volumes and a higher risk of hematoma expansion on 24-hour follow-up imaging. Regardless of time from the beginning of the symptoms, the accuracy in predicting hematoma expansion is high. Additionally, it is associated with intraoperative active bleeding and may help determine which patients are likely to benefit from surgical intervention.
