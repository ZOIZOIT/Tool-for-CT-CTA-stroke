According to the American Stroke Association, about 13 % of strokes happen when a blood vessel ruptures in or near the brain. [1] Intracranial hemorrhage according to the location can be classified as intracerebral, subarachnoid, subdural, or epidural, all of which, except subdural hemorrhage, are usually caused by arterial bleeding. Intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage are the 2 types of hemorrhagic stroke. The mechanisms through which hemorrhage may interfere with cerebral function include a variety of situations such as destruction or compression of brain tissue, compression of vascular structures, and edema. Blood collection in the brain tissue may be toxic, causing the cells in that area to weaken and die.
