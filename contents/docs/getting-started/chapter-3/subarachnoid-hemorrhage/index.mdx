title: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
---

Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is the third most common subtype of stroke [89]. The most common symptom is the onset of thunderclap headache that is sudden painful, unexpected and intense. This may be accompanied by signs of meningeal irritation, brief or prolonged loss of consciousness, and focal neurological deficits such as cranial nerve palsies or limb weakness. Sometimes the presentation may be non-specific.

SAH increases intracranial pressure and leads to cerebral dysfunction because of hypoperfusion, direct tissue destruction, and toxic constituents of subarachnoid blood. Complications such as vasospasm (leading to ischemia), rebleeding, extension of blood into brain tissue (producing an intracerebral hematoma), or hydrocephalus may occur.

Diagnosis is typically confirmed with a head CT scan and may be followed by a lumbar puncture if needed. A CT within 6 h of a thunderclap headache can have 98·7% sensitivity [89][91]. Angiography will not reveal an aneurysm in approximately 15% of patients [89][92]. The Fisher scale is an initial system of classifying the amount of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on non-contrast CT scans. Fischer score is primarily used to predict the risk of vasospasm following a SAH and, therefore, delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). The higher the score is, the higher the risk is. The modified Fischer scale includes two important factors, the amount of subarachnoid blood and the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).

According to the modified Fischer scores there are 5 grades:

**Grade 0:** No SAH, NO IVH

**Grade 1:** Minimal/thin SAH, no IVH in both lateral ventricles

**Grade 2:** Minimal/thin SAH, with IVH in both lateral ventricles

**Grade 3:** Thick SAH (completely filling ≥1 cistern or fissure) no IVH in both lateral ventricles

**Grade 4:** Thick SAH (completely filling ≥1 cistern or fissure) with IVH in both lateral ventricles
